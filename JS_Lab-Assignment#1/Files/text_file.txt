In 2014, Lana Del Rey told a journalist that she wished she was dead, and for 
what seemed like years after, scarcely an article was written about her that 
didnâ€™t mention it. Back then, the singer was still miserable at the sour critical 
reception of her debut album. She was, perhaps, peddling its underlying 
fatalism, pushing back on allegations that her noirish Born to Die persona was 
fabricated. Almost certainly, she was harboring the sort of creative ambition 
that craved association with tragic geniuses like Kurt Cobain and Amy Winehouse.
